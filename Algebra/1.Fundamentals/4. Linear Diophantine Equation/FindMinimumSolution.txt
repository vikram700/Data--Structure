so for finding min(x+y) solution for diophantine equation
        

        all solution is given as

            x = x0 + k * (b/g);
            y = y0 - k * (a/g);

    x + y = x0 + y0 + k * ((b-a)/g);

    here x0, y0, a, b and g are contant.

    so

    case 1 : when a < b 
             so for this we need to find min values of k as possible.
    case 2 : a > b
             for this we need to find max values of k as possible.
    case 3 : a == b
             for this all solution are same and as (x0 + y0).

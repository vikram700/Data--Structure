For an equation there may be infinite no of solutions present.

so suppose an equation have one solution describe in previous problem(finding one solution for the equation)
                   
                   a * x0 + b * y0 = c;
                   
                   where 
                         x0 = xg * (c/g);
                         y0 = yg * (c/g)
    
    add b/g to x0 and sub. a/g to y0;

                  a(x0 + b/g) + b(y0 - a/g) = c;

                  so 
                      x = x0 + k * (b/g);
                      y = y0 - k * (a/g);

so for all values of k there infinite no of solution may present.

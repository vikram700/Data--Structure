Problem 1 :

You have a string S of length N. You are given Q queries of form Li,Ri. For each query, print "YES", if substring denoted by SLi,SLi+1...SRi is a palindrome. Both N,Q≤105.

Problem 2 :

 You have a string S of length N. Given an M≤N, find the number of substrings of S that are palindrome and are of size M. Given that N≤105
// this is same as Problem 1.

 Problem 3 :

  Given a string S, find the size of  substring of largest size which occurs atleast twice in the string.

  // this can we easily solve using binary_search + hashing O(N * logN ^ 2);
